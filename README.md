## TASK 3
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, that adds support for large and multi-dimensional arrays, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. A feature of NumPy used here is the repeat function. Using the `np.repeat` function elements of the array can be repeated along different axises. NumPy can also be used to arrange the elements of the array in ascending order using the function `np.argsort`.
