## TASK 1- Linear and Logistic Regression - HelloWorld for AIML
### Linear Regression- Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. 
Linear regression predicts the relationship between two variables by assuming a linear connection between the independent and dependent variables.   
I split our dataset into train and test sets (80% for training, and 20% for testing).

### Logistic Regression-
The data tells that there are 3 different species of iris
setosa: represented by 0
versicolor: represnted by 1
virginica: represented by 2
Predicting the spices of a given iris using the sepal width and length and petal width and length.
Each value we are predicting becomes the response here called the target.

## TASK 3 - Numpy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, that adds support for large and multi-dimensional arrays, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. A feature of NumPy used here is the repeat function. Using the `np.repeat` function elements of the array can be repeated along different axises. NumPy can also be used to arrange the elements of the array in ascending order using the function `np.argsort`.
